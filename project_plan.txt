PROJECT PLAN: DESC KAGGLE SALARY PREDICTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Week1 (Sep 9th - Sep 16th):
  Data Wrangling
  - Standardise "Title" column: try to identify "generic" positions and remove additional information
    such as technical skills, the location of the job, whether it is fulltime/part time. All of this
    information can be useful features, but should not be in the Title column.
  - Clean up "Source" column: e.g. just keep website company name, e.g. remove "www." and ".com" etc)
    This might be a useful feature, possibly some job sites only advertise senior/higher paid  jobs
  - "Contract Type" : can probably fill in missing values from this based on the "ContractTime"
    feature

  Feature Engineering
  - Extract new features
  - "Title": this feature lists a lot of technical skills (java, .NET etc) which can be extracted.
    It can also be used to gauge the seniority of the position advertised, the contract type,
    location etc...
  - "Full Description" : this also contains a lot of useful features on technical skills, seniority,
    and probably a lot more!
  - "LocationNormalized" : The location of the job could be related to the salary offered, e.g. jobs
    in London probably pay more than jobs in Northern Scotland. The locations could be grouped into
    a new "Region" feature or "IsLondon" feature for examples

Week1 OUTPUT: 1 clean dataset (.csv) with plenty of new features

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Week2 (Sep 16th - Sep 23rd):
  Modelling
  - Put the clean dataset through different ML models and try to identify what models might
    give the best results
  - Provide updates to the group on what has/hasn't worked
  - NOTE: Do not tune your models based on the "test" dataset. Tune should be carried out on the
    training dataset by using Cross-Validation. The "test" dataset should only be used to test
    the accuracy of your model after you have done all of your tuning.

  Week2 OUTPUT: A model (or ensemble of models) with strong accuracy scores
